I started this digest in March 2013 and it has since then been my full-time commitment. In the last several months I’ve landed several significant improvements and established a robust workflow. Now I would like to set up a stable income, so that I can continue providing this service.

Since its inception, I’ve provided this digest as a free service for the benefit of the web development community without a profit agenda. I would like to continue working in this way. I’ve therefore set up a voluntary subscription which enables the readers of this digest to opt-in into a monthly $6 subscription. With enough subscribers, I would receive an appropriate income and could continue providing this service.

*   **How long would you like to do this?**

                   Roughly, for another year or so. Maybe 2.
*   **How long do you work on one daily release?**

                   It takes me 7-8 hours of work to get one out.
*   **What amount are you looking for?**

                   Something in the range of a web developer salary.
*   **Should I subscribe?**

                   If you have an income and want this digest to stay active, then you probably should :-). I will share information about my income transparently.
*   **What if I don’t subscribe?**

                   Nothing changes for you. I’m happy to provide this digest to you for free.
*   **How will I be able to unsubscribe?**

                   Just log in to PayPal and find your subscriptions in the settings. (I’ll add screenshots later.)
*   **Can organizations give too?**

                   I may add an subscription option for them in a couple of weeks. We’ll see.

Btw, more detailed information about this digest and my workflow is available in the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/simevidas/webplatformdaily-site/blob/master/README.md).
